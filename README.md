# sem4StatsProject

The statistics project brief was to carry out a statistical analysis of a data set using R. I compiled and wrote a report based on my findings and interpretations of the data along with the results. I used R to compile all the graphs and every R command is included at the end of the report.

The report answers six questions in section 1. With section 2 containing more in depth questions on simple and multiple regression.
